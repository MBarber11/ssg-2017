		<h2>Tools for Every Step of the Process</h2>

		<div id="benefits-about-left">
		
			<h3 class="blue-headline">Intake Clients</h4>
			
			<p>As soon as a new child or family engages with your services, you can easily record and organize all necessary information to ensure they are matched with the correct services. Prenatal care, after-school services, college-prep or anything in between, you’ll be ready.</p>
			
			<h3 class="red-headline">Assess Needs</h4>
			
			<p>When an individual comes to your organization, it’s important to quickly establish their immediate needs. Whether tutoring, child care, job seeking, or otherwise, using our tools such as a Needs Assessment form your staff can easily assign the correct services to every individual.</p>
			
			<h3 class="yellow-headline">Provide Services</h4>
			
			<p>Develop individual plans to ensure you are providing the right services, in the right way at the right time. Easily enroll clients in programs and track progress related to specific programs and services to gain a comprehensive understanding of an individual or family’s progress.</p> <br><br>

		<div id="benefits-about-right">
		
			<h3 class="orange-headline">Collaborate</h4>
