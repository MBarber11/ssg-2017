			<h2>Center for Violence Free Relationships</h2>

			<p>In his early days on the job as Executive Director, Matt Huckabay saw a baby, teen mother, grandmother, and great grandmother arriving together for services at the Center for Violence Free Relationships. Three generations were traumatized by domestic violence. Would the baby grow up to be the fourth generation of victims? Using ETO, the Center can track individual and family progress against a specific set of outcomes to make informed, data-driven decisions – the kind of decisions that can truly change the course of someone’s life. </p>
