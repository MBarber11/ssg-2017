			<h2>Managing Outcomes for Community Collaborations</h2>
			
			<p>Making a positive impact on the community is often not a one-person, one-organization activity. It frequently requires the voluntary participation of many persons or organizations, and their provision of resources. It is practically impossible to establish a holistic, family-centric case management service delivery and performance management process without collaboration of some kind. That’s where we come in.</p>
