			<h2>Helping You Transform Lives</h2>

			<p>If you want to break the cycle of recidivism and make sure those who leave the corrections system reenter society successfully, you need an outcomes management tool that you can count on. Whether you help inmates while incarcerated or beyond, it is imperative to understand the impact your services have on clients to ensure they are self-sufficient and unlikely to recidivate.</p>
