			<h3>Love In the Name of Christ (Love INC) of Lancaster County </h3>

			<p>When Love INC chose Apricot Essentials as their ideal solution, Jessica Dunlevy came into a new role. She was responsible for maintaining and customizing a software solution, something she had never experienced.  "I’m not a computer programmer, I’ve never done this before… But with Apricot Essentials I can say, 'If this is the outcome I want, how am I going to build the forms to ensure I get the right information?' Apricot has been intuitive and simple enough that I have been able to put the building blocks together."</p>
