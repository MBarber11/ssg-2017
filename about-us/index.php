		<h2>History</h2>
		
		<p>In 2000, Social Solutions was launched by a small team of direct service workers who wanted to improve the effectiveness of social services. They asked themselves: How much effort does it take to produce desired outcomes for specific groups of clients? Efforts to Outcomes (ETO®) software was the result—a solution that would allow staff to record their efforts at the point of service delivery and relate those efforts to client outcomes down the road. In 2015, Social Solutions acquired CTK and began to sell Apricot Software, a secure and flexible nonprofit software solution that offers case management, client, donor and volunteer tracking as well as outcomes management.</p>
