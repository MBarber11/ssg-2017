			<h3>Maryland Center for Developmental Disabilities</h3>

			<p>Chris Smith, the Director of the MCDD, needed to answer the question, "How is it you know you’ve made a diﬀerence today?"  Apricot allowed him to find one. Using the outcomes analysis tools, he discovered a fascinating insight: African American children with autism were more likely to be misdiagnosed as intellectually disabled. Once he saw this trend, he could propose a new approach that better trained doctors in areas that haven’t traditionally served children with autism. This helped more children beneﬁt from a faster, more accurate diagnosis, leading to better care for life.</p>
